pycli-cryptopycli-crypto is a powerful and convenient Python command-line application designed for encrypting and decrypting text, numbers, or entire files directly from your terminal. It handles all its dependencies internally, ensuring a clean and self-contained experience with no leftover files.FeaturesEncrypt Text or Files: Securely transform your sensitive data into an encrypted token.Decrypt Tokens: Convert encrypted tokens back into their original text or file content.Zero External Requirements: All necessary Python packages are managed and installed by the application itself within a temporary, self-cleaning virtual environment.Clean Operation: Leaves no trace of temporary files or installations on your system.How It WorksWhen you run pycli-crypto, it intelligently sets up a temporary, isolated Python environment (a virtual environment) in the background. It then installs any required libraries (like cryptography) into this temporary space. Once your encryption or decryption task is complete, this temporary environment and all its contents are automatically removed, leaving your system exactly as it was before. This means you don't need to manually install any dependencies!InstallationThere are no external installation steps required for pycli-crypto!Simply download the main.py script (and any accompanying modules directory if present) and place it in a location accessible from your command line. The script is designed to be self-sufficient and will manage its own dependencies upon execution.Usagepycli-crypto uses command-line flags to determine whether to encrypt or decrypt and what data to process.EncryptionTo encrypt data (text or a file), use the -e or --encrypt flag along with either -d (for direct data) or -f (for a file path) and your chosen password with -p or --password.Encrypting Text:python main.py -e -d "Your secret message here" -p "YourStrongPassword"
Encrypting a File:python main.py -e -f /path/to/your/secret_document.txt -p "YourStrongPassword"
If you encrypt a file, pycli-crypto will automatically suggest saving the encrypted output to a new file with a .enc extension (e.g., secret_document.txt.enc).DecryptionTo decrypt an encrypted token, use the -d or --decrypt flag along with either -d (for the token string) or -f (for a file containing the token) and the original password with -p or --password.Decrypting a Token (from command line):python main.py -d -d "a1b2c3d4e5f6..." -p "YourStrongPassword"
(Replace a1b2c3d4e5f6... with your actual hexadecimal token)Decrypting a Token (from a file):python main.py -d -f /path/to/your/encrypted_token.enc -p "YourStrongPassword"
